## Description

This study guide was made to help new bootcamp students understand the fundementals of coding like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The project contains information and notes pertaining to these subjects. By making my own study guide from scratch. I learned the basic codes to form a webpage, I learned how to string basic functions and how to execute codes to make an action happen. What motivaited me was how the code works when everything goes right, It makes me feel even more accomplished and makes me want to push further. i built this program so that all my notes on one webpage. The study guide makes it easily accessiable and easy to digest, it solves the problem of writing and making everything easy to understand, Its also acts as a good practice to run codes.
